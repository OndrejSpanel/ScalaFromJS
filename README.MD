Scala from JavaScript
=====================

Experimental project to see if automated or assisted conversion from JS to Scala.js is possible.

Minimal functionality is to make using JS examples from Web in Scala easier.
  
If everything works well, larger goal may be added later, like automated or assisted conversion of larger JS projects.
